#### REMEBER BEFORE TO EXECUTE THE TEST, YOU NEED HAVE EXECUTING THE YARN START. YOU NEED RUN THE PROJECT BEFORE TO EXECUTE THE TESTS

Launches the test runner (test created with cypress).\

### Test information

In this project the test was created using Cypress for END-TO-END test, because in my experience with this type of simple project is better
only test the visual functionality.

When you will run the script cypress will open a window and in there you can find the differents files of the modules, and if u wanna run some test
only you need click in the files that have the ext "spec.js" that are the test. 

IF YOU WANNA RUN ALL THE TEST -> only need when cypress open the new window of the test, you need click in the > Run Integration specs that you can 
see in the main window
